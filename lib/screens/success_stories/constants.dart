I visited the institute and found the environment very comfortable but my financial condition was very weak so I contacted the social worker and she got a sponsor to pay my fees. I joined the course and learnt about beauty and self confidence. After the completion of the course, I joined a beauty parlor as a beautician. I feel very happy now, all thanks to the YWCA." - Neeta Nakva''',
  '''"I am an orphan. I chose the nursing course because I wanted to do something for the society. After completing SSC, I joined the nursing course at YWCA in 2006. After I completed my course I started private patient duty at the Breach Candy Hospital and earned Rs 1400 per day. Now I am mentally and financially strong and successful in life. I am really thankful to YWCA to make me stronger and financially independent" - Sunita Ghosalkar''',
  '''"The Scholarship that I received from YWCA has helped me pay my college fees. My mom is not working and she falls sick very often, so she cannot work much, and she could not afford to pay for college. Had it not been for the help we received from YWCA, I do not know where would I have been. The scholarship too motivated me to study and improve myself. - Molly''',
  '''"I am married and have three children. Three years ago my husband had a heart attack. He was the only earning person in my family. I decided to do the YWCA nursing course so that I could help my family. It was really a turning point in my life. I got a great opportunity to serve the sick and needy people. With the blessings and efforts of the teachers, I got a good job in BSES Hospital and I am getting a good salary. I am very grateful to YWCA as well as Aasra -family counselling centre." - Sanika Deoghare''',
